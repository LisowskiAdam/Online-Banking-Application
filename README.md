# ðŸŽ­ Playwright e2e Test Automation project

This repository serves as a preview of my end-to-end test automation skills using **Playwright** framework (**TypeScript**).

All the tests are written using **Page Object Pattern**, to ensure that all the test functions are easily maintainable and can be reused in the future tests, as the app is developed.

Feel free to download the repo and run all the tests using the following command:
> npx playwright test

You can also run the tests in headed mode, so that you can actually see the script navigating through the web app, by simply using the following command:
> npx playwright test --headed
